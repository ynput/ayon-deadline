For example, executing in a farm context, you can load a manifest file and trigger\n    multiple different shots for the current worker machine based on some database without reloading the\n    manifest file everytime.

This is useful when you want to render everything in a queue.\n\n*--user*: This options sets the author on the render job. If None is provided, the current logged-in user is used.\n\n*--remote/-r*: This option submits the render to a remote process.

This flag can be used with both modes of the script.\nWhen specifying a remote command for deadline, you'll need to also supply these commands:\n\n    *--batch_name*: This sets the batch name on the executor.\n\n    *--deadline_job_preset*: The deadline preset for Deadline job/plugin info\n</code></pre> Editor CMD window <p>.. code-block:: shell</p> <pre><code>$ py mrq_cli.py &lt;--remote&gt; sequence sequence_name map mrq_preset_name\n</code></pre> Editor Commandline <p>.. code-block:: shell</p> <pre><code>UnrealEditor.exe uproject_name/path &lt;startup-args&gt; -execcmds=\"py mrq_cli.py sequence sequence_name map mrq_preset_name --cmdline\"\n</code></pre> <p>In a commandline interface, it is very important to append <code>--cmdline</code> to the script args as this will tell the editor to shut down after a render is complete. Currently, this is the only method to keep the editor open till a render is complete due to the default python commandlet assuming when a python script ends, the editor needs to shut down. This behavior is not ideal as PIE is an asynchronous process we need to wait for during rendering.</p>"},{"location":"autoapi/client/ayon_deadline/repository/custom/plugins/UnrealEngine5/UnrealEnginePlugins/MoviePipelineDeadline/Content/Python/mrq_rpc.html","title":"mrq_rpc","text":""},{"location":"autoapi/client/ayon_deadline/repository/custom/plugins/UnrealEngine5/UnrealEnginePlugins/MoviePipelineDeadline/Content/Python/mrq_rpc.html#client.ayon_deadline.repository.custom.plugins.UnrealEngine5.UnrealEnginePlugins.MoviePipelineDeadline.Content.Python.mrq_rpc.MRQRender","title":"<code>MRQRender</code>","text":"<p>               Bases: <code>BaseRPC</code></p> <p>Class to execute deadline MRQ renders using RPC</p> Source code in <code>client/ayon_deadline/repository/custom/plugins/UnrealEngine5/UnrealEnginePlugins/MoviePipelineDeadline/Content/Python/mrq_rpc.py</code> <pre><code>class MRQRender(BaseRPC):\n    \"\"\"\n    Class to execute deadline MRQ renders using RPC\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"\n        Constructor\n        \"\"\"\n        super(MRQRender, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\n        self._render_cmd = [\"mrq_cli.py\"]\n\n        # Keep track of the task data\n        self._shot_data = None\n        self._queue = None\n        self._manifest = None\n        self._sequence_data = None\n\n    def _get_queue(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Render a MRQ queue asset\n\n        :return: MRQ queue asset name\n        \"\"\"\n        if not self._queue:\n            self._queue = self.proxy.get_job_extra_info_key_value(\"queue_name\")\n\n        return self._queue\n\n    def _get_sequence_data(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Get sequence data\n\n        :return: Sequence data\n        \"\"\"\n        if not self._sequence_data:\n            self._sequence_data = self.proxy.get_job_extra_info_key_value(\n                \"sequence_render\"\n            )\n\n        return self._sequence_data\n\n    def _get_serialized_pipeline(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Get Serialized pipeline from Deadline\n\n        :return:\n        \"\"\"\n        if not self._manifest:\n            serialized_pipeline = self.proxy.get_job_extra_info_key_value(\n                \"serialized_pipeline\"\n            )\n            if not serialized_pipeline:\n                return\n\n            unreal.log(\n                f\"Executing Serialized Pipeline: `{serialized_pipeline}`\"\n            )\n\n            # create temp manifest folder\n            movieRenderPipeline_dir = os.path.join(\n                unreal.SystemLibrary.get_project_saved_directory(),\n                \"MovieRenderPipeline\",\n                \"TempManifests\",\n            )\n\n            if not os.path.exists(movieRenderPipeline_dir ):\n                os.makedirs(movieRenderPipeline_dir )\n\n            # create manifest file\n            manifest_file = unreal.Paths.create_temp_filename(\n                movieRenderPipeline_dir ,\n                prefix='TempManifest',\n                extension='.utxt')\n\n            unreal.log(f\"Saving Manifest file `{manifest_file}`\")\n\n            # Dump the manifest data into the manifest file\n            with open(manifest_file, \"w\") as manifest:\n                manifest.write(serialized_pipeline)\n\n            self._manifest = manifest_file\n\n        return self._manifest\n\n    def execute(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Starts the render execution\n        \"\"\"\n\n        # shots are listed as a dictionary of task id -&gt; shotnames\n        # i.e {\"O\": \"my_new_shot\"} or {\"20\", \"shot_1,shot_2,shot_4\"}\n\n        # Get the task data and cache it\n        if not self._shot_data:\n            self._shot_data = json.loads(\n                self.proxy.get_job_extra_info_key_value(\"shot_info\")\n            )\n\n        # Get any output overrides\n        output_dir = self.proxy.get_job_extra_info_key_value(\n            \"output_directory_override\"\n        )\n\n        # Resolve any path mappings in the directory name.
